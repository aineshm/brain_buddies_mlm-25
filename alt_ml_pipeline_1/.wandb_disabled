# WandB Disabled

This pipeline uses **MLflow** for experiment tracking, not WandB.

## Why WandB is Disabled

Ultralytics YOLO has built-in WandB integration that tries to initialize automatically during training. This causes conflicts because:

1. WandB tries to use the file path as a project name (invalid)
2. We want to use MLflow for consistency
3. WandB requires account login

## How WandB is Disabled

In `src/training/train_baseline.py`, we set environment variables:

```python
os.environ['WANDB_DISABLED'] = 'true'
os.environ['WANDB_MODE'] = 'disabled'
```

This tells Ultralytics to skip WandB initialization entirely.

## Using MLflow Instead

All experiment tracking is done through MLflow:

```bash
# View experiments
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri ~/mlm_outputs/alt_pipeline_1/experiments/mlflow

# Open browser to http://localhost:5000
```

MLflow provides:
- ✅ Local storage (no cloud account needed)
- ✅ All metrics, parameters, and models tracked
- ✅ Web UI for visualization
- ✅ Model versioning and artifact storage

## If You Want to Use WandB

If you prefer WandB:

1. Remove the environment variable lines from `train_baseline.py`
2. Login: `wandb login`
3. Update config.yaml: `tracking_backend: "wandb"`

But MLflow is recommended for this pipeline.
